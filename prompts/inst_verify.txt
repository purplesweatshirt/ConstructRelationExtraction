#Definitions
Constructs/ Latent Variables: Latent variables are unobserved constructs that cannot be directly measured but are inferred from a set of observed variables. They represent abstract concepts such as intelligence, satisfaction, or anxiety.
Observed Variables: Observed variables, also known as indicators, are measurable variables that are used to estimate the latent variables. They are the data points collected through surveys, experiments, or other methods.
Path Coefficients: Path coefficients, also known as beta values, are the (standardized) regression weights that represent the strength of the relationship between two variables in a SEM model.
Construct relation: Construct relation refers to a hypothesized relationship between latent variables (constructs)

# Instruction
Consider the context (section Context) from a scholarly article and the hypothesized construct relations (see section Construct relation) below.
The construct relations were extracted from this context paragraph and need to be verified by you. You are responsible for a high quality of the output!
Use the context paragraph and your general knowledge on structural equation modeling to verify whether the relation has been correctly extracted. 
You should take the following into account: 
1. Are the construct names legit names for latent variables (i.e., no observed variables, no placeholder names [e.g., model1, variable x, construct 1, ...], )?
2. Check if the latent variables, path coefficient and significance were correctly extracted?
3. Is there missing information (e.g., mediators/moderators, path coefficient, p value)?
4. Are moderators/mediators correctly extracted? A variable names consisting of two different construct names combined by "x", "->", etc. indicate that there is a mediator/moderator involved that has not been extracted correctly. 
5. Is this construct relation logical? Are these really constructs that can be related as proposed in the sentence?

#Output Format 
Your answer has to include only one python list specifying the revised construct relation. 
The list should contain two construct names, the moderator/mediator, the beta coefficient, and the p-value. 
If the moderator/mediator, beta value or p-value is not mentioned, mark it as None. 
The list should be structured as follows: [construct_from (str), moderator/mediator (str or None), construct_to (str), beta value (float), p-value (str or float or None)]. 
Strictly follow this order for the list, the specified data types and ensure this is valid Python syntax!
If you came to the conclustion that this construct relation was hallucinated, output an empty list ([]).

# Examples
Construct relation: "Weekly hours worked" is related to "job satisfaction" (beta = -0.30, p < 0.05). No mediator or moderator.
Output: "Weekly hours worked" is an observed variable not a construct, Output: []
Construct relation: "EOU" is related to "ATU -> PU" (beta = 0.50, p < 0.01). No mediator or moderator.
Output: The relation seems to include a moderator or mediator which was not detected. Output: ["EOU", "ATU", "PU", 0.50, "< 0.01"]
Construct relation: "Job Satisfaction" is related to "Organizational Citizenship Behavior" (beta = 0.35, p < 0.05)
Output: This relation seems to be legit. Output: ["Job Satisfaction", None, "Organizational Citizenship Behavior", 0.35, "< 0.05"]
Construct relation: "Job Satisfaction" is related to "Organizational Citizenship Behavior" (beta = 0.35, p < (0.11, 0.232))
Output: The signifance is not a p-value, it seems to be a confidence interval. Output: ["Job Satisfaction", None, "Organizational Citizenship Behavior", 0.35, None]
